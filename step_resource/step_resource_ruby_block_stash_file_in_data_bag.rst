The following example shows how to use the |resource ruby_block| resource to stash a |bittorrent| file in a data bag so that it can be distributed to nodes in the organization.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # the following code sample comes from the ``seed`` recipe
   # in the following cookbook: https://github.com/mattray/bittorrent-cookbook

   ruby_block 'share the torrent file' do
     block do
       f = File.open(node['bittorrent']['torrent'],'rb')
       #read the .torrent file and base64 encode it
       enc = Base64.encode64(f.read)
       data = {
         'id'=>bittorrent_item_id(node['bittorrent']['file']),
         'seed'=>node.ipaddress,
         'torrent'=>enc
       }
       item = Chef::DataBagItem.new
       item.data_bag('bittorrent')
       item.raw_data = data
       item.save
     end
     action :nothing
     subscribes :create, "bittorrent_torrent[#{node['bittorrent']['torrent']}]", :immediately
   end
